# Simulation of Graph Algorithms with Looped Transformers

This repository contains the source code for our paper: [Simulation of Graph Algorithms with Looped Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01107). It includes the network implementations used to simulate the following graph algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm, and Kosaraju's Strongly Connected Components Algorithm (SCC).
